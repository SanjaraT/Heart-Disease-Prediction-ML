--> Overview

This project predicts heart disease using machine learning. A complete pipeline was implemented, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison using ROC-AUC, and hyperparameter tuning.

--> Dataset

Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset
Target: 0 (No disease), 1 (Disease)

--> Methods

One-hot encoding for categorical features
Feature interaction engineering
Train/Validation/Test split (70/15/15)
StandardScaler for numerical features

--> Models

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting

--> Evaluation Metric: ROC-AUC

--> Best Model: Tuned Random Forest

--> Final Results (Test Set)

Accuracy: 97%
ROC-AUC: ≈ 0.98
